How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It just shows you the differences and the old vs new content of the file, so you can focus on what has changed
You won't miss any difference because you'll get all them as result of the command, and you can run it again
to double check that the file has been reviewed according to what you expect


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It helps you to see the evolution in the code, and find when you introduced a bug. If you use it to blame who did it 
that is fine, but you should use is to learn on other errors and even from your own mistakes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros - you can choose the way it works better for you

Cons - you don't get a consistend commit policy if you are not consistent on your decisions

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is code oriented, so is more likely you want to track changes for multiple files in a single commit action
Google Docs is document oriented, so the changes are only related to a single document. No interdocument relations are allowed


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Use git log to get the list of all changes, and search for the changes you are interested in

The use git diff to see the changes between two commits (from git log) and you'll get them hightlighted in nice colors!


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You can always go back to a previous version so the bug is removed, and then investigate when has the bug been introduced.



Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to start using in my personal projects in github
