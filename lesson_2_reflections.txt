What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Metadata is created in a hidden folder.
You have to initialize the repository so git can keep track of the changes on the 
files you want git to do so.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

These files are under control of git and you can commit them.
You see them as added to the repository and pending to commit
The ones not added in the working directory are shown as pending to add
This helps you to know what are you working on and what is pending
