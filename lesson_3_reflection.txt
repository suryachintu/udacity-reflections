When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to share my code with others, or when I want a safe backup of my code.
This also allows collaboration.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You want to be on control of what you pull and when, so you can merge.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork : a copy of a git repo in github. GitHub keeps track of the fork, so you know where the fork comes from
and the other repository knows how many forks has

Clone : copy a repo into a local git repo

Branches : copy current commited code into a diferent commit-tree in local
