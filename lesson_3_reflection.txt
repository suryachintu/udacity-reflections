When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to share my code with others, or when I want a safe backup of my code.
This also allows collaboration.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You want to be on control of what you pull and when, so you can merge.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork : a copy of a git repo in github. GitHub keeps track of the fork, so you know where the fork comes from
and the other repository knows how many forks has

Clone : copy a repo into a local git repo

Branches : copy current commited code into a diferent commit-tree in local


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can the merge offline the 2 branches, or compare (git diff)

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Sending emails, copying files, or using another version control web site (any svn)

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

You are adding a new feature, and you want someone to review before it becomes it part of master.
You create a branch so you give the oportunity to others to review a pull request with the changes before merging into trunk.
